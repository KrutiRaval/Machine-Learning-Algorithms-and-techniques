# Linear Regression

Solved regression problems using the linear model as a part of supervised learning X -> y where X is the input and y is the output. The goal we want to acheive in this problem is to find a best fit on all the data. Training is given to the models to gain expected output by fitting the training samples into our models. The aim here is to apply different learning algorithms on the Regression dataset and then predict accurate output from our labeled input by training it. Linear model is the dot product between two vectors.

A one dimensional vector represents a straight line and so it is called <b>linear</b>.This model does not more complexity so it's represntation is also simple.Thus for the assignment we need to generate the output values of 'y' as close as we can to the target outputs. For that we will visualize the data and understand the plots from the dataset, perform necessary validations,cleaning and preprossesing of the data. we will do dimentionality reduction or feature scaling as well if needed. Different methods of linear models like <b>LS (least-squares) and LMS (Least-mean-squares)</b> will be applied to achieve the best fit line and the desired results. At the end, comparision of both the methods and algorithms would be made for the better understanding and optimality of the Linear Models.
