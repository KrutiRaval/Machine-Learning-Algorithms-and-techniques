# Classification

The main objective here is to gain proper understanding and solve classification problems using different algorithms, as a part of supervised learning. In machine learning, classification is the problem of identifying where the new observations belong in a set of categories, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations whose category is known.

The purpose is to identify the machine learning algorithm that is best-suited for the classification problem at hand, thus comparing different algorithms and selecting the best performing out of all. The main focus is on prediction accuracy and good generalization performance, such that the model maximizes its prediction accuracy. In this process we would consider mainly 4 different algorithms to solve the classification problem such as :

1. Pocket Algorithm
2. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
4. Logistic Regression

Using these four classification algorithms, we can check the performance and determine the efficiency of each algorithm and also compare it's performance with the other. 
We will also understand and use the classification measures like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Specificity and so on to measure the accuracy and precision of the classification model.
