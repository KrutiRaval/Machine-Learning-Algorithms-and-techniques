The main objective here is to learn Neural Networks and implement various neural network algorithms. Neural networks are actually a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed and used to recognize patterns. By labeling or clustering raw input, the neural networks interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception. The purpose of a neural network is to learn to recognize patterns in the data. Once the neural network has been trained on the same of data (we have used regression data here), it can make predictions by detecting similar patterns in future data. In this assignment we will learn about Cross Validation, Nonlinear Regression and Nonlinear Logistic Regression for our neural network Models.
